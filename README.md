# Motivation

If you are an owner of a larger Discord guild or a guild with a lot of roles and channels to manage, you may be annoyed by clicking and tweaking around in the discord overlay to create channels, roles and permissions for each of them. So, I thought, the best way to make this a bit easier, there must be a script-like tool which you can use to batch-execute Discord guild management operations - in best case timable and repeatable. So, I decited to create this script "language" to do so ;)

# Development state

This projekt is currently in a very early state of development. Actually, there is nothing really working currently, but I want to share the development phase of this project and maybe collect some tips to improve this plan.

# Don't be rude, contribute!

Yes, I am an absolute python noob and I have never written a kind of language interpreter before, so this will be a quite interisting learining situation for me working at this project. So, if you are more confortable with python and language interpreter design, I would really appreciate your contribution. :)
